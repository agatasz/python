Finding motif by amino acid's properties

	Fuction find_motif("sequence.fasta","PATTERN") is responsible for searching and locating motifs, which correspond to the pattern gave as an argument of the function. Pattern could be the combination of numbers (property) and letters (1-letter amino acid code). Properties of amino acids:
  1 - polar
  2 - nonpolar
  3 - neutral (charge)
  4 - positive (charge)
  5 - negative (charge).
  
	For example pattern "A2W" means that on first position in motif should be alanine, on the second position some nonpolar amino acid and on the third position should be tryptophan.
